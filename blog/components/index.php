              Hello there!
              My name is Captain Olimar, an interstellar traveler and employee of the Hocotate Freight company.
              I come from a distant planet called Hocotate, and I’ve spent much of my life exploring unknown worlds and cataloging exotic lifeforms.<br>

              One day, I crash-landed on a mysterious planet teeming with small, plant-like creatures I came to call Pikmin.
              They may be tiny, but with teamwork, they're incredibly powerful allies. Together, we’ve survived dangerous environments, battled fierce predators, and recovered important ship parts and treasures.<br>

              I may be small in size, but my adventures have taught me the value of courage, strategy, and trust in my companions.<br>

              Nice to meet you, and remember — even the smallest beings can make a big difference!
